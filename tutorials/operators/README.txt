Operators
=========

To approximate numerical solutions to partial differential equations using the finite volume method,
we must be able to apply the following mathematical operations to discrete quantities living on mesh:

    - Interpolation
    - Averaging
    - Gradient
    - Divergence
    - Curl

The following tutorials demonstrate the basic construction and application of these operators.
