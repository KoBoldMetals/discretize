Meshes
======

A mesh is a numerical grid on which discrete approximations of continuous functions and variables live.
Meshes can be created to discretize and solve 1D, 2D or 3D problems.
For a given system of partial differential equations, the mesh defines a discrete representation of the domain and its boundaries.
Here, we provide a set of tutorials related to generating and understanding mesh types supported by the *discretize* package.
